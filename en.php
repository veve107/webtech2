        The administrator will log in to the application with the password you generated.<br>
        The whole page will be bilingual.<br>
        See the following pages for a more detailed description of the tasks.<br>
        Within the tasks, data in the form of csv files will be imported into the application. In case you are
        to save to the database (the first two tasks), so always import them into only one table for the task.<br>
        Adding additional columns to the table as well as adding additional tables to the database is possible. Ensure that
        in the case of duplicate file upload to the database, the data in the database is updated.<br>
        When working on a project, it is necessary to use a versioning system, e.g. 'Github', while in the technical documentation
        must be the address where your storage is located.<br>
        Individual pages of the created portal must be responsive and customized for printing !!.<br><br>",
